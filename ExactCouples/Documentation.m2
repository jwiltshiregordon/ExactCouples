    Description
        Text
            There are a lot of details to record.  (The following is actually describing
                distinguishedTriangleLaw, and I've since decided that it is too technical
                to be useful to ordinary users)

            Suppose $R$ is a ring of coefficients, and that the triangle ring Q takes
            the form $Q = R[d,e,f]/(d^2,e^3)$.  Write $Even$ for the subgroup generated
            by $(deg d)$ and $(deg f)$.  Since Q is a triangle ring, we know $(deg e)$ is
            not an element of $Even$, but $2 * (deg e) = (deg d) - (deg f)$, and so
            $2 * (deg e) \in Even$.

            We also know that $Even$ admits a group homomorphism $sgn : Even \to \{1,-1\}$ to
            the multiplicative unit group of $\ZZ$ so that


            $sgn(d) = -1$


            $sgn(f) = 1$.


            Write $All$ for the subgroup generated by $Even$ and the element $(deg e)$ so
            that $|All : Even| = 2$.

            The true grading group of $Q$ might be much more than just $Even$.  In this case,
            a general degree $\alpha$ can be written $\alpha = (\alpha // All) + (\alpha % All)$.
            In what follows, we assume all degrees are in $All$ by replacing $\alpha$
            by $(\alpha // All)$ if necessary.

            We define an additive functor $r : R[d,e,f]/(d^2,e^3) \to R[d,f]/d^2$ by the
            following formulas.


            Set $\delta, \epsilon, \phi$ to be the degrees of $d, e, f$.  A general even degree
            takes the form $\alpha = a * \delta + b * \phi$, and $\alpha + \epsilon$ is then odd.


            {\bf The right adjoint}


            On degrees:


            $r(\alpha) = \alpha \oplus (\alpha + 2\epsilon)$


            $r(\alpha + \epsilon) = \alpha + 2\epsilon$


            On entries with even row-degree {\tt alpha}, $d, e, f$ become

        CannedExample
            | d  0 |         |     0     |         | f  0 |
            | f -d |         | sgn alpha |         | 0  f |
        Text
            On entries with odd row-degree, $d, e, f$ become
        CannedExample
             | d |              | 1  0 |            | f |
        Text
            These matrices give the usual construction of the mapping cone and its related maps.
            It is easy to check that these six matrices commute when composable.  The most interesting
            case is
        CannedExample
            | d  0 | * |        0        |  ==  |     0     | * | d  0 |
            | f -d |   | sgn (d * alpha) |      | sgn alpha |   | f -d |
        Text
            which holds because $sgn (d * \alpha) = sgn(d) * sgn(\alpha) = -sgn(\alpha)$.
            It must also be checked that these matrices satisfy the relations $d^2=e^3=0$.

            {\bf Constructing the left adjoint}

            We want to find a left adjoint to $r$ so that we can compute $r^*$ as $l_!$.
            The key fact is that $r^*$ takes free modules to free modules.  Specifically,
            a free module with generator in degree $\alpha$ becomes a free module with
            generator in degree $\alpha - \epsilon$.  The new basis vector
            is encoded in the adjunction unit, whose component at an even degree $\alpha$
            takes the form

        finds the long exact sequence associated to a map of R[d]/d^2-modules
    Usage

    Outputs

            for a ring of the form R[e,f,Degrees=>\{\{1,0},\{-2,2}}]
    Description
        Text
            Suppose $m:A \to B$, where A and B are considered cochain complexes by virtue
            of the square-zero action of d.  Writing C(m) for the mapping cone of the map m, the long
            exact sequence in cohomology takes the form

            $\cdots \to H^p A \to H^p B \to H^p C(m) \to H^{p+1} A \to \cdots$

            The output module M is bigraded, and encodes this sequence as follows:

            $\cdots \to M_{\{1,2p\}} \to M_{\{-1,2p+2\}} \to M_{\{0,2p+2\}} \to M_{\{1,2p+2\}} \to \cdots $

            where the maps are multiplication by $e$ or $f$, in the repeating pattern $...,e,f,e,e,f,e,e,f,e...$.
            In other words, for all $p \in \ZZ$,

            $M_{\{1,2p\}} = H^p A$

            $M_{\{-1,2p\}} = H^{p-1} B$

            $M_{\{0,2p\}} = H^{p-1} B$;

            Multiplication by e induces the maps $H^{p-1} B \to H^{p-1} C(m) \to H^{p}A$ and

            Multiplication by f induces diagonal maps $H^p A \to H^p B$.

            Note that this setup leaves the odd rows empty.  The reasoning behind these conventions
            is explained in @ TO "Conventions and first examples" @.
        Example
            R = QQ[x]; S = R[d] / ideal(d^2); declareGenerators(S, {a => {0,0}}); A = cospan(x^2*a, d*x*a)
            declareGenerators(S, {b => {0,0}}); B = cospan(x^2*b, d*b)
            m = map(B, A, matrix {b});
            LES = longExactSequence m;
            excerptLES(0,2,LES)
    Caveat
        The source and target of m must be homogeneous, and m itself must be degree-preserving.  If the variable
        d has degree different from 1, then the other degrees are adjusted to match d.

        The output module usually has nonzero entries outside of the three columns of interest indicated above.
        This is because we compute M by building a natural exact couple associated to m, and other nonzero
        entries appear organically.

            Let $R=QQ[x,y,z]$, and suppose X is a cochain
            complex of R-modules, expressed as a module for the ring R[d]/d^2.  To obtain the module in
            cohomological degree k, evaluateInDegree({k},X) suffices.  But what if we want to evaluate
            in *polynomial* degree k?

            In order to evaluate X in polynomial
            degree g, however, we must restack the ring.
        Example
            R = QQ[x,y,z]; E = R[d]/d^2;
            C = coker map(E^{{0,0},{0,-2},{-1,-3}},E^{{0,-2},{-1,-6}},{{x^2+y^2+z^2,d},{-1,0},{0,-x*y*z}})

    Caveat
        Each stage of R may only introduce relations among the most-recent variables.  So, in the last
        example, C=B[p,q]/(p^3-2*q^3) was allowed, but C=B[p,q]/(x*p^3-2*y*q^3) would not be.

    Description
        Text
            Any map of cochain complexes gives a long exact sequence in cohomology.
            Considering M to be a sequence of cochain complexes connected by maps---
            the cochain complex structure comes from the action of d, and the maps
            come from the action of f---we obtain an interlocking sequence of long
            exact sequences.

            The output module encodes the exact couple by placing the page data
            in degrees of the form (2*p, 2*q) and the auxilliary data at the
            midpoints of the differentials.  (The 2s ensure that
            these midpoints are still valid bidegrees.)

            We build the cochain complex for the simplicial complex with vertices
            \{a,b,c\} and facets \{ab,ac,bc\}, placing it in row 0.  In row 1,
            we mod out by (bc); in row 2, by (ac,bc), continuing until every simplex
            is annihilated in row 7.

            R = QQ[d,t,Degrees=>{{0,1},{1,0}}]/d^2;

        Text
            Suppose the ring of M is the couple ring R[e, f].

            Let S be the subring R[e^2, f].  Homogeneous elements of S are restricted to
            an index-two subgroup of the bidegrees of M; as an S-module, M splits as a
            direct sum of its even part and its odd part.  We write A for the odd part
            and E for the even part.  Multiplication by e induces maps from E to A and
            back again.  Since M encodes an exact couple, we have

            image(f : A --> A) = kernel(e : A --> E)

            image(e : A --> E) = kernel(e : E --> A)

            image(e : E --> A) = kernel(f : A --> A).

            The derived couple then replaces A with image(f : A --> A) and E with
            ker(e^2 : E --> E) / im(e^2 : E --> E).  Our grading convention is logical,
            if nonstandard.  Since the differential on E is e^2, which the the composite
            E -e-> A -e-> E, we place A at the midpoint of the differential.  Moreover,
            since the construction of the derived couple makes use of the first isomorphism
            theorem between the image and coimage of f, which therefore have equal claim
            to being A', we place A' at the midpoint of f.  We keep E' in the same
            degrees.

            This all works well, except that the degree of f must be divisible by 2
            so that A' can live at its midpoint.  The current implementation doubles
            all degrees of the input module so that these midpoints exist and are
            unique.  In a future version of M2 that allows grading by a general abelian group,
            the user would be expected to supply a degree that doubles to the degree of f.

            R = QQ[d,t,Degrees=>{{0,1},{1,0}}]/d^2;
            declareGenerators(R,{a=>{0,0},b=>{0,0},c=>{0,0},ab=>{0,1},ac=>{0,1},bc=>{0,1}});

        specifics on encoding exact couples as modules for a ring
    Description
        Text
            {\bf Encoding an exact couple as a module for a ring}

            An exact couple is a pair of R-modules E and A together with maps A --> E --> A and A --> A
            with the conditions that

            im(A --> E) = ker(E --> A)

            im(E --> A) = ker(A --> A)

            im(A --> A) = ker(A --> E).

            In this package, exact couples are encoded by an action of R[e,f] on the direct sum
            $M = A \oplus E$, where e acts by the maps  A --> E --> A, f acts on A by the map A --> A,
            and on E by 0.  A ring of the form R[e,f]
            form is called a 'couple ring' and the degrees of its variables must satisfy
            the conditions in @ TO expectCoupleRing @.

            The module E is the "page" and the module A is the "auxiliary".  Typically, E and A occupy
            disjoint sets of degrees, termed "even" and "odd".  The terms of the spectral sequence live
            in even degrees, since they come from the page.  The auxiliary data lives in odd degree.

            {\bf Constructing exact couples}

            Exact couples arise in algebra any time a chain complex $C=(C,d)$ carries a self map
            $f : C \to C$.  Setting $A = H_* C$ to be the homology of $C$, and $E=H_* C(f)$ to be
            the homology of the mapping cone of $f$, we have a long exact sequence

            ... ----> A ----> E ----> A --f--> A ----> ...

            defining the maps in the exact couple.

            The all-purpose method
            @ TO exactCouple @ accepts as input C considered as an $R[d,f]/d^2$ module.
            Note that the action of $d$ and $f$ is encoded by the ring action.


            To build exact couples by hand, use @ TO declareCouple @, and check your work with
            @ TO isHomogeneous @ and @ TO expectExactCouple @.  For the usual long
            exact sequence induced by a map of complexes, use @ TO longExactSequence @.
            Once you have an exact couple, @ TO derivedCouple @ produces another, as we now explain.

            {\bf Derived couples}

            Every exact couple determines a new exact couple by the formulas $A' = im(f)$ and
            $E' = ker(e^2)/im(e^2)$.  The maps $A' \to E' \to A'$ are induced by $e$, and the
            map $A' \to A'$ is induced by $f$.  There is a wrinkle, however: the map
            $A' \to E'$ factors $A' \to A / ker(f) \to E'$, making use of the first
            isomorphism theorem.  Some degree confusion can result.  Indeed, the inclusion
            $A' \subseteq A$, which is induced by the identity, is a degree 0 map; in contrast,
            the projection $A / (ker f) \to A'$, which is induced by $f$, has the same degree
            as $f$ itself.  This forces the inverse map $A' \to A / ker(f)$ to have degree $-deg(f)$.

            If we had taken A' to be the coimage of f instead of the image,
            this would have resulted in different degrees.  So either of these conventions
            would have an assymetry: an unjustified preference for image or coimage.

            We use neither convention.  Instead, we place A' exactly halfway between
            (image f) and (coimage f).  This has the effect of giving the comparison
            maps $A \to A' \to A$ the same degree, namely, $(degree f)/2$.  (This division-by-two
            accounts for the requirement in @ TO expectCoupleRing @ that the degree of $f$ be even.)

            The new degrees can be expressed in terms of the old:


            $ degree f' = degree f$


            $ degree e' = (degree e) - (degree f) / 2$.


            The resulting ring $R[e',f']$ is the derived couple ring of $R[e,f]$; it acts on the
            derived couple, and can be obtained using @ TO derivedCoupleRing @.
        Text
            {\bf How to determine $deg(e)$ and $deg(f)$ in your example}

            Suppose you have in mind a particular spectral sequence of $R$-modules,
            starting on page k,
            and you want to program
            its exact couple.  What degrees should you use for the couple ring $R[e_k,f_k]$?

            Think about the degree of $D_k$, the differential on the starting page.  This tells
            you the degree of $e_k$:

            $deg(e_k) = deg(D_k)$.

            Now think about the degree of $D_{k+1}$, the differential on the next page.  This
            lets you compute the degree of $f_k$:

            $deg(f_k) = 2 * deg(D_k) - 2 * deg(D_{k+1})$.

        a singly-graded spectral sequence built from the chain self-map "multiplication by p"

        Text
            {\bf Bockstein Spectral Sequence}

            Let p be a prime number, and suppose C is a chain complex over the integers; then
            multiplication by p induces a chain map $C --> C$, and so we have a chain complex
            with a self-map, placing us in the algebraic context to obtain an exact couple.

            For example, let C be the cellular cochain complex for the real projective space
            $\mathbb{R}P^3$ and its usual cell structure with a single cell in each degree:

            Z --0--> Z --2--> Z --0--> Z ----> 0

            Name the classes p0, p1, p2, and p3, specify the differential by imposing relations of
            the form d*pk = d(pk), and set t to act by 2
            by tensoring with R^1/(t-2) (this is a convenient way to impose the relation that
            every generator g has t*g = 2*g):
        Example
            Q = ZZ[d, f, Degrees => {1,0}]/d^2;
            declareGenerators(Q, {p0 => 0, p1 => 1, p2 => 2, p3 => 3});
            C = cospan(d*p0, d*p1-2*p2, d*p2, d*p3) ** Q^1/(f-2); C
            isHomogeneous C
        Text
            This C is the right sort of module to give to exactCouple since it carries an action
            of a ring of the form R[d,f]/d^2
        Example
            bock = exactCouple C
            expectExactCouple bock
            P1 = prune pageModule(1,D,bock)
        Text
            Since the generators of the E_1-page are annihilated by 2, the same will be true on subsequent pages.
        Example
            P2 = prune pageModule(2,D,bock)
            P3 = prune pageModule(3,D,bock)
        Text
            It is always the case that the the pages
            of the Bockstein spectral sequence are defined over the field ZZ/p; indeed this is its
            main useful property.
        Example
            P1' = prune(map((ZZ/2)[D_1],ring P1) ** P1)

        exact couple associated to a fibration
    Description
        Text
            {\bf Homology Serre spectral sequence for the Hopf fibration}

            The Serre spectral sequence can be constructed by choosing a cell structure
            on the base space, and looking at the induced filtration on the total
            space.  In the case of the Hopf fibration $p: S^3 \to S^2$, and making use
            of the easy cell structure on S^2 with only two cells, we obtain the
            following filtration:

            $X_k = \emptyset$ for $k \leq 0$

            $X_0 = X_1 = S^1$

            $X_k = S^3$ for $k \geq 2$

            --The homology exact couple of a filtered space has $A = \oplus_{p,q} A_{p,q}$ with
            --$A_{p,q} = H_p X_q$ and $E_{p,q} = H_p(X_q , X_{q-1})$.  The maps are then
            The homology exact couple of a filtered space is built from the various long exact
            sequences associated to the pairs $(X_p , X_{p-1})$.

            Its first page is the relative homology, and its first auxiliary is the
            (absolute) homology.  The variables act as follows:

            $f : H_n X_p \to H_n X_{p+1}$

            $e : H_n X_p \to H_n(X_p , X_{p-1})$

            $e : H_n(X_p , X_{p-1}) \to  H_{n-1} X_{p-1}$,

            where this last map is the usual connecting homomorphism.  In our example, the most
            interesting long exact sequence concerns the pair $(S^3,S^1)$.  Since the homology of
            $S^3$ and $S^1$ are pretty sparse, the homology of the pair is determined by isomorphisms

            $e : H_3 S^3 \to H_3(S^3,S^1)$ since $H_3$ and $H_2$ vanish on $S^1$

            $e : H_2(S^3,S^1) \to H_1 S^1$ since $H_2$ and $H_1$ vanish on $S^3$

            $H_1(S^3,S^1) = 0$ since $H_1 S^3 = 0$ and $H_0 S^1 \to H_0 S^3$ is an injection

            $H_0(S^3,S^1) = 0$ since $H_0 S^1 \to H_0 S^3$ is a surjection.

            This analysis shows that the four groups $H_0 X_0$, $H_1 X_0$, $H_2(X_2, X_1)$, and
            $H_3 X_2$ are free abelian of rank one.
            Let $x \in H_0 X_0$, $y \in H_1 X_0$, $z \in H_2(X_2,X_1)$, and $w \in H_3 X_2$
            be generating classes for these groups.

            By the general properties of exact couples, we have that $e^2$ annihilates auxiliary
            generators and $f$ annihilates page generators.  It turns out that
            the only remaining relation in the exact couple is $e*z - f*y$, which says that
            the connecting map $H_2(X_2,X_1) \to H_1(X_1)$ sends $z$ to the same place as the
            filtation map $H_1(X_0) \to H_1(X_1)$ sends $y$.  (Depending on your choices for
                generators, this relation may read $e*z + f*y$.)

            It is straightforward to give all this information to M2, but determining
            degrees does take a bit of thought the first time you do it.  We continue the example
            by {\bf analyzing degrees ...}

            Since we have specific degree preferences (exactly
            double the usual ones for a Serre spectral sequence) we will
            do this by hand rather than relying on the default degrees provided by @ TO coupleRing @.

            The usual Serre spectral sequence has $E^1_{pq} = H_{p+q}(X_p , X_{p-1})$, so we place
            this module in degree \{2p,2q}.  The module $A^1_{pq} = H_{p+q} X_p$ sits
            halfway along the map $E^1_{pq} \to E^1_{(p-1)q}$, so it has degree \{2p-1,2q}.

            In usual indexing, the differential has degree \{-1,0}, so our differential has degree
            \{-2,0}.  On the other hand, since the differential is given by $e^2$, this means that
            the degree of $e$ itself is \{-1,0}.  (And in general, the degree of e in our conventions
            should be the degree of the differential in the usual conventions.)

            Everything so far has been about the first page, $E^1$.  However, the easiest way to
            determine the degree of $f$ is to consider the second page.  The usual conventions give
            that the differential on $E^2$ has degree \{-2,1}, and so (by the same argument as above)
            this is the degree of $e_2$.  We have generally $deg e_{k+1} = deg e_k - (deg f_k)/2$.
            Solving, we see that the degree of $f = f_1$ is 2 * (\{-1,0\} - \{-2,1\}) = \{2,-2}.

            We conclude the general rule that{\bf ... the degree of e_k in our convention equals the
                degree of the page-k differential in the standard convention; the degree of f_k is then
                given by $2 * (deg e_k - deg e_{k+1})$.}

            We are now able to set up the couple ring.
        Example
            R = QQ;
            Q = R[e_1,f_1,Degrees=>{{-1,0},{2,-2}}];
        Text
            Now it is time to build the couple.  We give our couple ring to the function
             @ TO declareCouple @, together with names and degrees for our generating classes.  The
            page generators are always given first, and the auxiliary generators second.
        Example
            declareCouple(Q, {z => {4,0}}, {x => {1,0}, y => {1,2}, w => {5,2}})
        Text
            The couple we have built is "free" in the sense that the only relations imposed
            are the tautologous ones that hold in every exact couple (f acts by zero on the page,
                and e^2 acts by zero on the auxiliary).  To obtain our couple, we must impose the
            relation $e*z-f*y$.
        Example
            C = cospan(e_1*z-f_1*y)
            isHomogeneous C
            expectExactCouple C
        Text
            Since @ TO expectExactCouple @ accepts C without an error, we truly have an exact couple,
            and are ready to compute its spectral sequence.

            The next line displays the some entries in the first four pages of the
            spectral sequence determined by C.

            This time, the generator in degree \{2,0} maps via D_2 to a nontrivial element in degree \{0,1}.
            Since the module has no additional generators in that degree, the differential is an isomorphism
            between these two degrees.  Computing the next page shows the cancellation:

    Description
        Text
            For notational convenience, set $X = A_m$, and
            extend the sequence $A_i$ to all $i \in \ZZ$
            by setting $A_i = 0$ for $i < 0$, and $A_i = X$ for $i > m$.

            The returned couple $M$ is a module for
            the ring R[e_1,f_1,Degrees=>\{\{-1,-1},\{0,2}}].
            We describe the module $M$ in every bidegree $\{s,t}$.  The description
            depends on the parity of $s$ and $t$.


            If $s$ and $t$ are both even, say $\{s,t} = \{2p, 2q}$, then

            $M_{s,t} = Tor_p(W,A_q/A_{q-1})$;

            if $s$ and $t$ are both odd, say $\{s,t} = \{2p+1,2q+1}$, then

            $M_{s,t} = Tor_p(W,A_q)$;

            and otherwise, if $s$ and $t$ sum to an odd number, then $M_{s,t} = 0$.

            The variables $e_1$ and $f_1$ act by the maps in the
            various long exact sequences

            $Tor_p(W, A_{q-1}) \to Tor_p(W, A_q) \to
             Tor_p(W, A_q / A_{q-1}) \to Tor_{p-1}(W, A_{q-1})$.

            {\bf Associated spectral sequence}

            The spectral sequence associated to this couple converges to $Tor_p(W,X)$.
            The differential on page $r$ has bidegree \{-1,-r}.  The first page has

            $E^{pq}_1 = Tor_p(W,A_q/A_{q-1})$.

            Setting $F^p_q = image(Tor_p(W,A_q) \to Tor_p(W,X))$, the infinity page has

            $E^{p,q}_{\infty} = F^p_{q} / F^p_{q-1}$.

    Description
        Text
            The truncation of a chain complex is engineered to have homology only in certain degrees.
            There are several possible conventions.  We use the "coker" convention so that a complex

            ... - - -> C_{i-1} - - -> C_i - - -> C_{i+1} - - -> ...

            when truncated at position i, becomes

            ... - - -> C_{i-1} - - -> C_i - - -> coker d - - -> 0 - - -> 0 ...

            This convention has computational benefits (it does not require any gb calculation) but
            has the conceptual drawback that the natural map from the truncation into the original
            complex is not an inclusion.  At the level of the filtered derived category, however,
            all is well.  Some more details would be good, but this function is not yet being
            used for anything, so we stop here.

    Description
        Text
            The
            filtered versions are described in detail at their individual
            pages @ TO TorCouple @, @ TO contravariantExtCouple @, and
            @ TO covariantExtCouple @.  We invite the reader to check these first,
            since the corresponding spectral sequences are easier to describe.

            The remainder of this page describes an alternative, and more-general way of using these
            three functions.  Specifically, we
            explain how to use a graded R[t]-module in place of a filtered module.

            The idea is to replace a sequence of inclusions with a general sequence of maps.
            The first page then consists of the homology of mapping cones, which play the role
            of the associated graded.
            If the variable t acts by inclusions, the mapping cone is quasi-isomorphic to the
            associated graded, and we recover the filtered case.

            {\bf How to use the R[t] versions}

            The schematic for using these generalized versions: replace the "submods" argument, which is
            an increasing list of submodules of a fixed R-module, with a "seqmod" argument which
            is a module for a ring of the form R[t].

            Such a seqmod can be built directly, or from a sequence of maps using
            @ TO sequenceModule @.

            In the case of contravariantExtCouple, the appropriate sequence module (the one generalizing
                the filtered case) is not the one corresponding to the filtration, but rather the
            cofiltration $X/A_i$.  So, in recovering the filtered case, the variable t acts by surjections.

            These generalized versions also allow a symbol as the first argument, which will be used
            to name the variable "e" in the resulting couple ring.  (The variable "f" in the couple
            ring will be named after the variable (ring seqmod)_0).
        Example
            R = QQ[x,y,z]
            A = coker matrix {{x^2+y^2+z^2}};
            B = coker vars R;
            toSeqMod = cm -> ( -- This short function converts chain modules to sequence modules
                amb := ambient ring cm; -- by forgetting that the action of d squares to zero.
                pres := lift(presentation cm, amb); -- It can be replaced by pushForward once that
                coker(pres | (id_(target pres) ** (matrix {{(amb_0)^2}}))) -- function is fixed.
                );
            B' = toSeqMod chainModule(res B)
            torCouple = prune TorCouple(A,B')
            plotPages((-3..3,-4..2,1..3), prune @@ evaluateInDegree, torCouple)
            covExtCouple = prune covariantExtCouple(A,B')
            plotPages((-3..3,-4..2,1..3), prune @@ evaluateInDegree, covExtCouple)
            contraExtCouple = prune contravariantExtCouple(B' ** (ring B')^{{-4,0}},A) -- see Caveat
            plotPages((-3..1,-5..1,1..3), prune @@ evaluateInDegree, contraExtCouple)
        Text
            It bears mentioning that there are many other spectral sequences arising from Tor and Ext.
            For example, both coordinates could vary instead of just one, or these functors could be composed
            in various
            ways.  For such applications, work directly with the function @ TO exactCouple @.  If you
            obtain anything compelling, the author of this package would appreciate hearing
            about it!
    Caveat
        In the case of @ TO contravariantExtCouple @, the module seqmod should be concentrated in degrees
        that are positive multiples of $deg(t)$.

        induced maps between couples and spectral sequences
    Description
        Text
            The exact couples described in @ TO "Exact couples for Tor and Ext" @ are functorial in
            a sense that we explain here.

            As a basic first example, suppose we have two R-modules, $X$ and $Y$, two submodules
            $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$, and a map $g : X \to Y$ with $g(A) \subseteq B$.

            Fix some other R-module W.  Applying Hom(W,-), we obtain two long exact sequences in Ext

            $0 \to Hom(W,A) \to Hom(W,X) \to Hom(W,X/A) \to Ext^1(W,A) \to \cdots $

            $0 \to Hom(W,B) \to Hom(W,Y) \to Hom(W,Y/B) \to Ext^1(W,B) \to \cdots $

            and downwards maps induced by $g$ that give a commuting ladder.

            The pages @ TO "Exact couples for Tor and Ext" @ and @ TO covariantExtCouple @ explain how
            to build each row of this ladder individually, but how can we obtain the downward maps?

            In brief, we encode the action of g by introducing a ring R[g] and reformulate the ladder
            as a long exact sequence over this larger ring.  Each vertical rung becomes a snippet of a graded
            R[g]-module (since there are two rows, we only care about g-degrees 0 and 1).  So the final
            output is a long exact sequence of R[g]-modules recording the two sequences in degrees 0 and
            1 and the map as multiplication by g.
            
            Shapiro's lemma allows us to compute this new sequence in terms of a single covariant Ext couple 
            over R[g].  Specifically, we replace W with an appropriate R[g]-module W', and
            replace X, Y, A, B with a single R[g][t]-module M encoding their comparison maps, and then
            call covariantExtCouple(W',M).

            {\bf A small example}

            Set R = $\QQ[z]$, and build the commuting square
        CannedExample
            |   A - - t - -> X
            |   |            |
            |   g            g

            by giving a presentation over the ring R[g][t], placing A in bidegree \{0,0}.  The example square
            we have in mind:
        CannedExample
            |  cokernel {3} | z13 | - z^2 -> cokernel {1} | z15 |
            |           |                             |
            |           z                             z
            |           |                             |
            |           v                             v
            |  cokernel {2} | z6 |  - x^2 -> cokernel {0} | z8 |
        Text
            Building it is a matter of naming generators, specifying degrees, and imposing relations.
        Example
            R = QQ[z]; S = R[g][t]; declareGenerators(S,{a=>{0,0,3},x=>{1,0,1},b=>{0,1,2},y=>{1,1,0}});
            M = cospan(z^13*a,z^15*x,z^6*b,z^8*y,g*a-z*b,g*x-z*y,t*a-z^2*x,t*b-z^2*y); isHomogeneous M
            eid = prune @@ evaluateInDegree; (dt, dg) = degree \ (S_0, S_1);
            {A,X,B,Y} = (deg -> prune eid({deg#1},eid({deg#0},M))) \ ({0,0},dt,dg,dt+dg);
            netList {{A, X}, {B, Y}}
        Text
            We also need another module W.
        Example
            W = R^1 / (R_0^10);
        Text
            Since R[g] is projective as an R-module, Shapiro's lemma applies, and Ext can be computed
            over R[g] if we replace W with its extension.
        Example
            W' = extensionInDegree({0}, coefficientRing S, W)
        Text
            And now we can build the couple.
        Example
            couple = prune covariantExtCouple(W',M)
            expectExactCouple couple
        Text
            To view the long exact sequence, we use @ TO excerptCouple @.
        Example
            excerptCouple({-2,2},4,couple)
        Text
            Note that each entry in this long exact sequence is still an R[g]-module.
            This is by design!  The long exact ladder is now encoded as an exact sequence
            of R[g]-modules whose degree 0 part and degree 1 part make up the two exact
            rows,
            and where the action of g gives the ladder's rungs.

            {\bf Interpreting the output}

            As an example, we focus on the bottom nonzero entry in the middle column:
        Example
            relHom = eid({0,2},couple)
        Text
            The degree \{0,2} comes from the conventions explained at @ TO covariantExtCouple @, which
            also explains that relHom, when expanded along
            its g action, should look like this:
        CannedExample
            |   Hom(W,X/A)
            |       |
            |       g
            |       |
            |       v
            |   Hom(W,Y/B)
        Text
            By evaluating in degrees 0 and 1, we verify that relHom has these expected values.
        Example
            (eid({0},relHom), Hom(W,coker map(X,A,{{z^2}})))
            (eid({1},relHom), Hom(W,coker map(Y,B,{{z^2}})))
        Text
            We can also compute the action of g on relHom in these degrees:
        Example
            eid({1}, relHom ** matrix {{g}})
        Text
            {\bf Contravariant functoriality}

            We give a similar example for @ TO contravariantExtCouple @, evaluating on a cofiltration
            (surjections instead of inclusions).
            See @ TO "Exact couples for Tor and Ext" @ for more details on this way of
            using contravariantExtCouple.

            Start with a commuting square of R-modules
        CannedExample
            |   X - - t - ->> C
            |   |             |
            |   g             g
            |   |             |
            |   v             v
            |   Y - - t - ->> D
        Text
            For convenience, set A = ker(t : X - -> C) and B = ker(t : Y - -> D).  If Z is some other
            module, we have a ladder
        CannedExample
            |   0 - - -> Hom(D,Z) - - -> Hom(Y,Z) - - -> Hom(B,Z) - - -> Ext^1(D,Z) - - -> ...
            |   |            |               |               |                 |
            |   g            g               g               g                 g
            |   |            |               |               |                 |
            |   v            v               v               v                 v
            |   0 - - -> Hom(C,Z) - - -> Hom(X,Z) - - -> Hom(A,Z) - - -> Ext^1(C,Z) - - -> ...
        Text
            To use Shapiro's lemma in this setting, we would like to replace the R-module Z with an
            R[g]-module Z' that captures the action of g on these Ext groups.  Such a Z' exists, but
            it is usually not finitely generated.  In this case, Z' would have a copy of Z in
            every non-positive degree.

            In order to maintain finite generation, we replace $R[g]$ with a quotient ring $R[g]/g^n$
            for some $n$ large enough to accommodate the maps we care about.  (In our case, we have
            a two-row ladder, so $R[g]/g^2$ suffices.  If we had other action maps, a similar truncation
            trick would work for larger rings $R[g,h,...]$.)

            Using the ring $R[g]/g^n$, we may take
        CannedExample
            Z' = extensionInDegree({-n+1},Z)
        Text
            since this module is isomorphic to the right Kan extension of Z to the ring $R[g]/g^n$; this
            module is also known as a "coinduced module".

            {\bf A small example}

            Set $R=\QQ[z]$, and build the commuting square
        CannedExample
            |  cokernel {5} | z6 |  - - ->> cokernel {5} | z3 |
            |           |                             |
            |           z5                            z5
            |           |                             |
            |           v                             v
            |  cokernel {0} | z10 | - - ->> cokernel {0} | z7 |
        Text
            As indicated above, since we only care about the map induced by the matrix
        CannedExample
            {0} | g |
        Text
            and not the action of g in other degrees, we may take n=2 since this number exceeds
            the row- and column-degrees of this matrix.
        Example
            erase(symbol x); erase(symbol y);
            n = 2;
            R = QQ[z]; S = (R[g]/g^n)[t]; declareGenerators(S,{x=>{0,0,5},y=>{0,1,0}});
            M = cospan(z^6*x,z^3*t*x,z^10*y,z^7*t*y,g*x-z^5*y,t^2*x,t^2*y); isHomogeneous M
            eid = prune @@ evaluateInDegree; (dt, dg) = degree \ (S_0, S_1);
            {X,C,Y,D} = (deg -> prune eid({deg#1},eid({deg#0},M))) \ ({0,0},dt,dg,dt+dg);
            netList {{X, C}, {Y, D}}
        Text
            Set Z to be $\QQ[z]/z^7$, and build the coinduced/Hom/right-Kan-extension module Z'
        Example
            Z = R^1 / (R_0^7);
            Z' = extensionInDegree({-n+1}, coefficientRing S, Z)
        Text
            We are now ready to build the couple using the larger ring.
        Example
            couple = prune contravariantExtCouple(M,Z')
            excerptCouple({-2,0},4,couple)
        Text
            It may be alarming to see non-zero entries in positions that appear at the point in
            the sequence that should hold Ext^3.  Fortunately, these entries disappear after
            evaluation at the two degrees \{0} and \{-1}, which are the two long exact sequences
            we are trying to relate.  (The degrees are negated because of
            contravariance.  Alternatively, we could have set the degree of g to be -1)

            To check this, we restack and evaluate
            to see both rows.
        Example
            --restack by hand
            Q = (R[j_1,k_1,Degrees=>{{1,-1},{0,2}}])[g]/g^n
            phi = map(Q,ring couple,{j_1,k_1,g,z},DegreeMap=>deg->deg_{2,0,1,3})
            C = phi ** couple
            C0 = evaluateInDegree({0},C)
            expectExactCouple C0
            C1 = evaluateInDegree({-1},C)
            expectExactCouple C1
            excerptCouple({-2,0},4,C0)
            excerptCouple({-2,0},4,C1)
        Text
            We can verify by recomputing these two sequences directly.
        Example
            A = image map(X,,{{z^3}});
            B = image map(Y,,{{z^7}});

        "Encoding diagrams as modules"
    Headline
        Building graded modules with specified modules in certain degrees, and with specified action maps
    Description
        Text
            Many algorithms in computer algebra accept as input a finite commuting diagram of modules.  
            This can pose a challenge to programmers, since specifying such a diagram can be unwieldy.
            For example, to input a commuting cube, a user could specify twelve maps in a list... but...
            these maps come without any preferred ordering, which makes any convention hard to remember,
            and moreover, the programmer will be forced to include
            many compatibility checks in order to supply useful error messages.
            
            This package takes the following approach, which we illustrate in the case of a commuting
            square (a cube would be similar).
            
            Let R be the base ring, and build a new ring
        CannedExample
            S = R[f,g,Degrees=>{{1,0},{0,1}}]
        Text
            A graded S-module is an infinite grid of R-modules connected by maps induced by multiplication
            by the variables f and g.  In particular, it encodes an infinite number of commuting squares!
            To specify a single commuting square, we restrict attention to the four bidegrees \{0,0\}, \{1,0\}, 
            \{0,1\}, and \{1,1\}.  (We could ask that the module vanish away from these degrees, but in
            practice it is more efficient to just say "we don't care what happens in other degrees".)
            
            {\bf Internal and external degrees}
            
            Some terminology, since the ring R may itself have some grading.  We call this grading 
            "internal" since it happens inside the coefficients.  The
            variables f and g have internal degree zero, even though their external degrees are \{1,0} and
            \{0,1} respectively.  When building a ring, the Degrees option specifies external degrees.  Suppose
            that R has degree length three so that deg(1_R) = \{0,0,0}, for example.  We have then
        CannedExample
            deg(f) = {1,0,0,0,0}
            deg(g) = {0,1,0,0,0}
        Text
            The first two coordinates are the external degree, and the last three are internal.  To obtain
            this information about a ring, you can use @ TO internalDegreeIndices @ and 
            @ TO externalDegreeIndices @.  For example:
        Example
            R = QQ[x,y,Degrees=>{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}]
            S = R[f,g,Degrees=>{{1,0},{0,1}}]
            internal = internalDegreeIndices S
            external = externalDegreeIndices S
        Text
            Later, given a multidegree, it is easy to find the internal and external degrees
        Example
            deg = {2,3,4,5,6}
            deg_internal
            deg_external
        Text
            We generally wish to accommodate a wide range of coefficient rings R, which in particular means
            we accommodate any number of internal degrees, including towers of rings where the coefficients
            themselves have coefficients, etc.  In such cases, all degrees that are not external count as
            internal.
            
            {\bf Example: encoding a commuting square}
            
            In this example, we take R=QQ[z].
        Example
            R = QQ[z]
            S = R[f,g,Degrees=>{{1,0},{0,1}}]
        Text
            We wish to encode a commuting square with the
            general layout
        CannedExample
            |   A - -g- -> B
            |   |          |
            |   f          f
            |   |          |
            |   v          v
            |   C - -g- -> D
        Text
            The downward maps will be encoded by the action of f, and the rightward maps by g.  Here
            is a particular example.
        CannedExample
            |  cokernel {3} | z13 | - z^2 -> cokernel {1} | z15 |
            |           |                             |
            |           z                             z

            |  cokernel {2} | z6 |  - x^2 -> cokernel {0} | z8 |
        Text
            We aim to encode this commuting square as an S-module.  
            The external degree will give
            the position in the commuting square, and the internal degree will record the R-degree.  Then,
            in a multidegree \{r,c,d\}, r gives the row (0 or 1 in our case), c gives the column (also
                0 or 1), and d gives the internal degree (usual grading on R=QQ[z]).
            
            {\bf Declaring generators}
            
            We begin the process in the upper left corner, with the module
        CannedExample
            |  A = cokernel {3} | z13 |
        Text
            Let us name the generator of this module $a$.  Since we
            are in the upper left corner, the external degree is \{0,0\}.  And since the generator appears
            in R-degree 3, the internal degree is \{3\}.  In total, then, the degree of $a$ is \{0,0,3\}.
            
            Similarly, let $b$, $c$, and $d$ be generators with external degrees \{0,1}, \{1,0}, and \{1,1},
            and with interal degrees 1, 2, and 0.  This information can be given to M2 using the function
            @ TO declareGenerators @.
        Example
            declareGenerators(S, {a => {0,0,3}, b => {0,1,1}, c => {1,0,2}, d => {1,1,0}})
        Text
            We must now impose relations on these four generators so that the four modules match our intent,
            and same for the maps.
            
            The first four relations come from the original descriptions of A, B, C, and D:
        CannedExample
            z^13*a
            z^15*b
             z^6*c
             z^8*d
        Text
            The next four relations come from the descriptions of the four maps:
        CannedExample
            g*a - z^2*b
            g*c - z^2*d
            f*a  -  z*c

            The first of these, for example, forces ga = z^2b, and this is what we want since g is 
            supposed to act by the horizontal map, which sends the generator for A to z^2 times the
            generator for B.   With these four relations, the action of f and g is determined in 
            the four degrees of interest.
        Example
            M = cospan(z^13*a, z^15*b, z^6*c, z^8*d,
                       g*a - z^2*b, g*c - z^2*d, f*a - z*c, f*b - z*d)
        Text
            The module M now contains a complete description of the commuting square.
            
            {\bf Evaluating a module at various external degrees}
            
            In order to check that M is correct, we can use the function @ TO evaluateInDegree @ to
            make sure the proper R-module lives in each of the four external degrees.
        Example
            netList apply(2, r -> apply(2, c -> prune evaluateInDegree({r,c}, M)))

            {\bf Evaluating a module at a structure map}
            
            In order to check the action of f and g, we use another form of evaluateInDegree.
        Example
            prune structureMap({0,0},,g,M)
            prune structureMap({1,0},,g,M)
            prune structureMap({0,0},,f,M)
            prune structureMap({0,1},,f,M)

            {\bf Example calculation: computing kernels of cokernels}
            
            In order to perform calculations on a diagram encoded as above, one main strategy involves
            changing which variables are internal and which are external.  In this example, we take
            the cokernel of the downward maps, and then take the kernel of the induced rightward map,
            resulting in a single R-module 
        CannedExample
            ker( coker(A - -g- -> B) - - -> coker(C - -g- -> D) )
        Text
            We want to take the cokernel of the g action map in a way that retains the action of f.  So
            build a ring where f is an internal variable, and only g is external:
        Example
            S' = R[f][g]
            phi = map(S',S,DegreeMap=>deg->deg_{1,0,2})
            isHomogeneous phi
            M' = phi ** M
        Text
            Since only g is external, we may evaluate to obtain a map of R[f]-modules, and then take its
            cokernel:
        Example
            cokerg = coker structureMap({0},,g,M')
        Text
            Now g is gone, and f is an external variable.  We may evaluate to obtain the map on cokernels,
            and take the kernel:
        Example
            ker structureMap({0},,f,cokerg)
